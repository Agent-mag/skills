## What This Skill Is

**Firecrawl Crawl** is an installable Agent Mag skill bundle. It gives your coding agent a focused prompt, optional tool definitions, and lightweight configuration so it can perform this job consistently inside your workflow.

## What It Does

Bulk extract content from an entire website or site section. Use this skill when the user wants to crawl a site, extract all pages from a docs section, bulk-scrape multiple pages following links, or says "crawl", "get all the pages", "extract everything under /docs", "bulk extract", or needs cont...

## Install

```bash
npx agentmag add skill firecrawl-crawl
```

## What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `manifest.json` | Registry metadata, category, compatibility, and tags |
| `prompt.md` | The core instructions that shape agent behavior |
| `tools.json` | Optional tool definitions the skill expects |
| `config.json` | Optional configuration values and defaults |

## When To Use It

- You need content from many pages on a site (e.g., all `/docs/`)
- You want to extract an entire site section
- Step 4 in the [workflow escalation pattern](firecrawl-cli): search → scrape → map → **crawl** → interact
- Always use `--wait` when you need the results immediately. Without it, crawl returns a job ID for async polling.
- Use `--include-paths` to scope the crawl — don't crawl an entire site when you only need one section.
- Crawl consumes credits per page. Check `firecrawl credit-usage` before large crawls.

## Compatibility

- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Copilot

## Setup Notes

- No required configuration is declared for this skill.
- Install it and review `prompt.md` for any optional adjustments.

- **Bash(npx firecrawl *)** — Tool: Bash(npx firecrawl *)

## Registry Metadata

- **Category:** Browsing & Search
