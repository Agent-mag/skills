## What This Skill Is

**Firecrawl Search** is an installable Agent Mag skill bundle. It gives your coding agent a focused prompt, optional tool definitions, and lightweight configuration so it can perform this job consistently inside your workflow.

## What It Does

Web search with full page content extraction. Use this skill whenever the user asks to search the web, find articles, research a topic, look something up, find recent news, discover sources, or says "search for", "find me", "look up", "what are people saying about", or "find articles about". Retu...

## Install

```bash
npx agentmag add skill firecrawl-search
```

## What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `manifest.json` | Registry metadata, category, compatibility, and tags |
| `prompt.md` | The core instructions that shape agent behavior |
| `tools.json` | Optional tool definitions the skill expects |
| `config.json` | Optional configuration values and defaults |

## When To Use It

- You don't have a specific URL yet
- You need to find pages, answer questions, or discover sources
- First step in the [workflow escalation pattern](firecrawl-cli): search → scrape → map → crawl → interact
- **`--scrape` fetches full content** — don't re-scrape URLs from search results. This saves credits and avoids redundant fetches.
- Always write results to `.firecrawl/` with `-o` to avoid context window bloat.
- Use `jq` to extract URLs or titles: `jq -r '.data.web[].url' .firecrawl/search.json`

## Compatibility

- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Copilot

## Setup Notes

- No required configuration is declared for this skill.
- Install it and review `prompt.md` for any optional adjustments.
